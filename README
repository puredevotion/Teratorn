=========================================================
This directory is the top-level directory of the source
code repository for this project. 

---Files---

omf/ --> this directory contains the source code for the version of OMF used
with this project (along with the changes made to OMF, which are roughly
documented with the patch omf/omf-5.2.patch). For in-depth information about
OMF, visit the following site: http://omf.mytestbed.net/

vmcontrol-0.9/ --> this directory contains the source code for vmcontrol, a
network daemon that functions as a watchdog for VMWare virtual machines.  The
directory contains a README with more information.

results/ --> this directory contains the raw experimental results used to
evaluate our project.

---Building the source---

While the code for this project doesn't need Debian to run, it is highly
recommended that Debian be used because the packaging for both vmcontrol and
OMF is Debian-based. Using Debian for packaging will make your live easier. 
After you package code, the program alien(1p) might be able to convert the
.debs into some other type of package such as a .rpm.

Before building the packages of either vmcontrol or OMF, it would be a good
idea to install the Debian package debhelper.

To build OMF run the following command:

    cd omf/omf-5.2 && make debs

This command will dump .debs in the directory omf/omf-5.2. They can then
be installed by running the command:

    dpkg -i $(name of deb)

where you subsitute the name of the deb for $(name of deb). Note: the packages
omf-aggmgr, omf-expctl should be installed on the server (or even separate
servers, if need be). The package omf-resctl should be installed on all the
nodes. Finally, omf-common should be installed with any other omf package.

To build vmcontrol run the following command:

    cd vmcontrol-0.9/ && dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

This command will dump .debs in the top-level directory.
