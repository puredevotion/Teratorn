Current Status
--------------
The OMF framework is a replacement for some of the existing components of 
orbit-lab software. 

Some of the reasons for cloning include:
 * to simplify the directory structure and dependencies, as discussed below
 * to allow for building outside of Winlab

OMF is a work in progress.
Status of specific components:
* All components build and install OK.
* PXE boots & runs, tested on VIA MB720 and MB770.
* nodeagent4 runs OK
* OTG (from current orbit-lab branch, not part of OMF) runs OK
