How to build OMF debian packages
--------------------------------

- make sure you have the "devscripts" package installed ("sudo apt-get install devscripts")
- enter the omf-... directory of the package you want to build
- if you've made any changes here and want to build a new version of the package, update the 
  changelog by running "dch -i -D hardy" where "hardy" is the release name you want to build for
- build the debian package by running "debuild -i -us -uc -b"
- the package can now be found in the parent directory
- use "dput packagename.changes" to upload it to your repository

How to build debian packages for the external dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------

The OMF debian packages depend on customised version of some external software. To build
these, follow this guide:

- enter the "external" directory
- run "debuild -i -us -uc -b" in the coderay, log4r and xmpp4r directories
- enter "emulab/oj/os/frisbee-080901" and run "debuild -i -us -uc -b" to build frisbee
- enter "emulab/oj/os/imagezip-080901" and run "debuild -i -us -uc -b" to build imagezip
- each debian package can be found in the parent directory of where it was built
- use "dput packagename.changes" to upload it to your repository
