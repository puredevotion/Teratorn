* Fix kexec(). We can kexec from debian stock kernel to orbit-pxe kernel
  but not the other way around. Problem with loaded ramdisk:

RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
RAMDISK: incomplete write (-28 != 32768) 8388608
crc error
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda1" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

Does the base kernel need ramdisk support (keep in mind if so the ramdisk size
should be >= initramfs CPIO archive) ?
mcgrof: I've tried booting with ramdisk support on both kernels enabled
and still run into the same problem. This needs further work.

* Move to buildroot, which moves us to uClibc. Can't do so at the moment 
  due to bugs in buildroot's ruby package, working on those bugs.

* Make a small nodeagent with only PXE required functionality in C.
  If this is finished first just jump to buildroot.

* On kernel config, try removing:
	CONFIG_SYSCTL
	CONFIG_SWAP +
	CONFIG_PROC_FS +
  + Once kernel is finalized

* Move imagezip and frisbee as applets to busybox

* Move getmac upstream to busybox

* We no have a udhcp.script which supports ip. Complete it by making it
  ifconfig/ip agnostic, then move upstream.
