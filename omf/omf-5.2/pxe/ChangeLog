	* Makefile: moved to busybox-1.5.0, linux-2.6.22.7, and initramfs. Moved
	out debian package building specs. Debian package specifics have been
	moved statically to debian/ dir. ChangeLogs are now split, this one
	refers to changes that doesn't have to do with the debian/ dir, 
	and debian/changelog deals with package-specific changes. Retrieve 
	nodeAgent deb instead of building from src (using make -C ../ nodeagent)

	* config/orbit-pxe-linux-2.6.20.4.config: takes advantage of
	CONFIG_EMBEDDED effort, removes swap and sysfs

	* config/enroll: use getmac, which is only ~9K, see getmac-1.0/README
