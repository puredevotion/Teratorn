This directory contains a flash based visualization widget to visualize
OML results.

It currently supports a timeline based visualization as well as one for graphs.

TODO:

Makefile based compilation of the swf files.
For the moment, the repository contains the compiled files in 'html-cache'

USAGE:

The widgets will ultimately move into the experiment controller, but the
graph widget can be tested with the '???' experiment as follows:

% cd src/ruby/omf_visualize
% ruby fetchMap.rb expId
