# == Description
#
# This file defines the SaveimageDaemon class.
#
require 'omf-aggmgr/ogs/abstractDaemon'

#
# This class implements an interface between the Saveimage Service of OMF and the 
# actual netcat instance running on the server. This class is used by 
# the SaveimageService class to interact with netcat. 
# Through its super-class AbstractDaemon, this class does not only represent a 
# single SaveimageDaemon instance, but it also provides a class-wide array of 
# SaveimageDaemon instances currently associated with the Saveimage Service.
#
