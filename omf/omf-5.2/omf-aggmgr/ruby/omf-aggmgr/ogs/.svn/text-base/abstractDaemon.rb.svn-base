# This class defines the general Daemon class. This class is used by all the 
# Services that calls an external daemon software to perform their required tasks.
# The AbstractDameon class serves as the interface between the GridServices of 
# OMF and the external daemon software.
# This class is meant to be sub-classed for a particular type of Daemon required by a Service.
# This class not only represent a single Daemon instance, but it also provides a class-wide
# array of Daemon instances currently associated with a Service.
