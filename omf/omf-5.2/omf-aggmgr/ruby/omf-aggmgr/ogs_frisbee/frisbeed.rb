# == Description

# This file defines the FrisbeeDaemon class.

require 'omf-aggmgr/ogs/abstractDaemon'

#
# This class implements an interface between the Frisbee Service of OMF and the 
# actual frisbee daemon software running on the server. This class is used by 
# the FrisbeeService class to interact with the frisbee software. 
# Throught its super-class AbstractDaemon, this class not only represent a 
# single FrisbeeDaemon instance, but it also provides a class-wide array of 
# FrisbeeDaemon instances currently associated with the Frisbee Service.
