  # Digraph is a directed graph which is a finite set of vertices
  # and a finite set of edges connecting vertices. It cannot contain parallel
  # edges going from the same source vertex to the same target. It also
  # cannot contain loops, i.e. edges that go have the same vertex for source 
  # and target.
  #
  # DirectedPseudoGraph is a class that allows for parallel edges, and a
  # DirectedMultiGraph is a class that allows for parallel edges and loops
  # as well.
