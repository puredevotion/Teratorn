 *				Should be less than SOCKBUFSIZE/BLOCKSIZE,
 *				bursts of greater than the send socket
 *				buffer size are almost certain to cause
 *				lost packets.
 *	SERVER_BURST_GAP	Delay in usec between output bursts.
 *				Given the typical scheduling granularity
 *				of 10ms for most unix systems, this
 *				will likely be set to either 0 or 10000.
 *				On FreeBSD we set the clock to 1ms
 *				granularity.

 * Together with the BLOCKSIZE, these two params form a theoretical upper
 * bound on bandwidth consumption for the server.  That upper bound (for
 * ethernet) is:
 *
 *	(1000000 / SERVER_BURST_GAP)		# bursts per second
 *	* (BLOCKSIZE+24+42) * SERVER_BURST_SIZE	# * wire size of a burst
 *

 * is about 17.4MB/sec.  That is beyond the capacity of a 100Mb ethernet
 * but with a 1ms granularity clock, the average gap size is going to be
 * 1.5ms yielding 11.6MB/sec.  In practice, the server is ultimately
 * throttled by clients' ability to generate requests which is limited by
 * their ability to decompress and write to disk.
