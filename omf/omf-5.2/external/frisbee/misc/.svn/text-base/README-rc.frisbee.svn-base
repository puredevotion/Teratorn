rc.frisbee is the script we run out of /etc/rc.local in standalone,
memory-filesystem-based FreeBSD that we use to load disks.  If all
goes well, the script runs at boot time, loading the disk and then
rebooting.  If the script fails, the machine continues booting up to
a login prompt where one can login to the console as root.

"tmcc" is the client-side of the Testbed Master Control protocol.  It
talks to the server-side ("tmcd") on the master Emulab server machine
("boss") to obtain information from the Emulab database.  It also is
used to signal state transitions to the DB (e.g., RELOADSETUP, RELOADDONE).

"IPoD" is the ICMP Ping of Death, a feature we have in our kernels,
that allows us to send a special ICMP packet to a machine to force it
to reboot.  Useful in some hang situations, but irrelevant here.

There is a lot of code in here for parsing FreeBSD dmesg output to
determine how much memory is in the machine and then to divide that
memory up for network/disk buffering in Frisbee.

After we (finally!) run Frisbee, we run "growdisk" which creates a DOS
partition (typically partition 4) containing all the extra space on the
physical disk.  We create our images for the least-common-denominator
disk we have (13GB) so the image will always fit on whatever disk we
have.  Note that growdisk (or rc.frisbee) does not create a filesystem
in the extra partition.  That is up to the user of the OS on the disk.

"slicefix" is a script intended to allow post-Frisbee customization to
the loaded partition or disk (note that partitions are called "slices"
in FreeBSD).  We do not currently use this.
