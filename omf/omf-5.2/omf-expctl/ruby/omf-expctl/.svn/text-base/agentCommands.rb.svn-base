# == Description
#
# During the experiment execution, the various Node Agent(s) (NA) send
# messages back to the Node Handler (EC). This module contains the methods 
# used by the (EC) to process the commands inside these messages.
#

module AgentCommands

  #
  # Process 'HB' message from a Node Agent. 
  #
  # - handler = the communicator that called this method
  # - sender = the object that issued this command (i.e. usually a 'Node' object)
  # - senderId = the sender ID 
  # - argArray = an array holding the arguments for this command
  #
  def AgentCommands.HB(handler, sender, senderId, argArray)
    sender.heartbeat(0, 0, "00:00")
  end

  #
  # Process 'ENROLLED' message from a Node Agent. 
  # The EC receives such a message when a NA has enrolled in a group of the experiment.
  #
  # - handler = the communicator that called this method
  # - sender = the object that issued this command (i.e. usually a 'Node' object)
  # - senderId = the sender ID 
  # - argArray = an array holding the arguments for this command
  #
  def AgentCommands.ENROLLED(handler, sender, senderId, argArray)
    sender.enrolled(argArray)
  end


  #
  # Process 'WARN' message from a Node Agent. 
  # The EC receives such a message when a NA sends a warning text.
  #
  # - handler = the communicator that called this method
  # - sender = the object that issued this command (i.e. usually a 'Node' object)
  # - senderId = the sender ID 
  # - argArray = an array holding the arguments for this command
  #
  def AgentCommands.WARN(handler, sender, senderId, argArray)
    MObject.warn("agentCmd::warning", sender, ": ", sender, " senderId: ", senderId, ":" , argArray.join(','))
  end

  #
  # Process 'WRONG_IMAGE' message from a Node Agent. 
  # The EC receives such a message when a NA has an installed disk image which 
  # is different from the one requested in the experiment description
  # For now, the EC reset/reboot that node, and tries to enroll it again. When
  # called within a LOAD experiment, this would trigger pxe booting and image loading.
  # (in the future, the EC should request AM to install the correct image)
  #
  # Note: This assumes that the XMPP server is actually keeping the last message 
  # addressed to a group for every new subscribers. Thus there is no need to send 
  # enrolling message again. If XMPP standard changes or server is not having 
  # this behaviour, then a enroll process will need to be started here.
  #
  # - handler = the communicator that called this method
  # - sender = the object that issued this command (i.e. usually a 'Node' object)

  # event that happened on the node.

  # event that happened on the node.

  # The EC receives such a message only when it is invoked with an experiment that
  # support temporary disconnection of node/resource from the Control Network.
  # In such case, after distributing the experiment description directly to the NA(s),
  # the EC enters a waiting state, where it waits for the NA(s) to report the end of 
  # the experiment.
  # Thus a given NA sends this message to the EC when it has finished executing the 
  # tasks describes in the experiment script for its particular nodes, AND when this
  # node is reconnected to the Control Network after a temporary disconnection. 
  # The EC will wait for an 'END_EXPERIMENT' from all the nodes involved in an experiment
  # before declaring that the experiment is indeed completed.
