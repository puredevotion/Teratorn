This package deals with the integration of OML (the measurment library) into OMF.

We distinguish two concepts. Measurment points are instrumentation points inside an application. 
They are defined and coded by the application developer. In the OMF context, they are defined
inside a +defApplication+ block through the +defMeasurment+ construct.

The second concept is that of a measurment stream. A experimenter defines what sub-set of
available measurments s/he is interested and what additional pre-processing (filter) should
be applied to the tuple stream originiating from a measurement point.

Measurment streams are threfore defined inside the +application+ commands of a node set of prototype
definition.

All the defined measurment streams and their associated filter definitions need to be combined into
a single configuration file for each application.

IMPLEMENTATION

AppDefinition Class
-------------------

  defMeasurement(id, description = nil, metrics = nil, &block)
  
   - id = identification of measurement point
   - description = some text describing this measurement point 
   - metrix = the metric to use 
   - block = an optional block to execute with this measurement point

This method creates an OML::MPoint and adds it to its set of avaialble measurment points. The
block will be executed in the context of the newly created MPoint to define the elements
of the measurement tuple offered by the application.


Application Class
-----------------

  measure(idRef, &block)

   - idRef = Reference to a measurement point
   - block = block of code to execute
   
 This indicates that the experimenter wants to collect measurements offered by the
 application's MPoint +idRef+ (identical to the +id+ in the above +defMeasurement+ declaration).
 This method creates a new OML::MStream and the block is executed in the context of this newly
 created object to further define what elements of the MPoint's tuple should be collected and what
 additional client side filtering should be performed. Please note that the resulting tuple can be
 very different than the one defined by the MPoint. This is important for the associated +defGraph+
 construct.
 
 NodeSet Class
 -------------
 
 In the process of declaring and configuring node sets, +Application+ instances are added to node sets
 either directly or via prototypes. Because of the prototype indirection, a specific +Application+ instance
 can be associated with multipe +NodeSet+ instances. However, the final configuration, it's command line arguments,
 environment, and OML settings depend on the context of the specific node set. Therefore, when adding 
 an +Application+ instance to a node set through a call to +Application#instantiate+ the application
 instance is creating an +ApplicationContext+ instance and adds that to the specified node set.
