# == Description
#
# This Ruby file contains various general declarations, which the NH will load 
# before the user's experiment file
#
# These declarations implement the process that loop, check and wait that all the 
# required nodes are UP, before proceeding with the remaining of the experiment
#

# Define some properties that we will use in this 
defProperty('resetDelay', 210, "Time to wait before assuming that node didn't boot")
defProperty('resetTries', 1, "Number of reset tries before declaring node dead")
# keeps track of how many times a node has been reset
ResetCount = {}

# 
# This declaration calls the 'everyNS' loop defined in handlerCommand.rb
# This declared bloc will be executed for all the existing node sets ('*') every 10sec
# This loop will stop when the bloc returns 'false', which will happen when all the nodes
# are UP
#
everyNS('*', 10) { |ns|

  # First check if we are done with adding node in that experiment
  # If not, we skip the checks and loop again in 10sec
  if NodeSet.frozen?
    # Yes, we are done adding nodes...
    nodesDown = []
    nodeCnt = 0
    # For each node in this Node Set, check if it is UP
    # Check that for 'resetDelay' time, if no sucess, reset the node
    # Do only 'resetTries' number of resets before giving up on a node
