Genny Sender is a custom UDP traffic generator that is able to send

packets at a constant bit rate. It can be configured to use libmac

or plain sockets as its underlying transport mechanism. Users can

change packet rates and payload lengths during the course of the

experiment. Genny sender uses pipes to accept run-time arguments

from users.
